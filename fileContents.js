            <h2>About Moran AI</h2>
            <p>Moran AI is a B2B SaaS platform that enables mid-market enterprises to automate and optimize their procurement workflows. Founded in 2023, our platform reduces procurement cycle times by 68% through AI-powered vendor matching, automated compliance checks, and real-time spend analytics.</p>

            <h3>Company Snapshot</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Founded:</strong> 2023, Delaware</li>
                <li><strong>Headquarters:</strong> San Francisco, CA</li>
                <li><strong>Employees:</strong> 47</li>
                <li><strong>Stage:</strong> Series A</li>
                <li><strong>Total Funding:</strong> $12.5M</li>
                <li><strong>Key Investors:</strong> Acme Ventures (Lead), Horizon Capital, TechFounders Fund</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Enterprise procurement teams spend an average of 23 hours per purchase order, managing fragmented vendor databases, manual approval workflows, and disconnected compliance systems. This results in $2.7T in inefficient corporate spending annually across US mid-market companies alone.</p>

            <h3>Our Solution</h3>
            <p>Moran AI provides a unified procurement platform that automates the entire purchase-to-pay lifecycle. Our AI engine matches purchase requests with pre-vetted vendors, routes approvals intelligently based on spend thresholds and policy rules, and provides CFOs with real-time visibility into committed and actual spend.</p>

            <h3>Key Metrics (as of Q4 2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ARR:</strong> $2.04M</li>
                <li><strong>Customers:</strong> 84 (mid-market enterprises)</li>
                <li><strong>Net Revenue Retention:</strong> 128%</li>
                <li><strong>MoM Growth:</strong> 12%</li>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To eliminate the friction in enterprise procurement, empowering every organization to spend smarter, faster, and with full transparency.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>By 2030, Moran AI will be the operating system for enterprise procurement — a world where every dollar spent by a company flows through an intelligent, automated, and fully compliant process. We envision a future where procurement teams are strategic partners to the business, not administrative bottlenecks.</p>

            <h2>Core Values</h2>

            <h3>1. Customer Obsession</h3>
            <p>Every product decision starts with the procurement team's pain points. We don't build features — we solve problems. Our roadmap is driven by customer feedback loops, not competitor benchmarking.</p>

            <h3>2. Radical Transparency</h3>
            <p>We believe in open communication — with our customers, our investors, and each other. Our spend analytics tools reflect this ethos: every dollar should be visible, every approval auditable.</p>

            <h3>3. Speed with Intention</h3>
            <p>We ship fast but never recklessly. We've built a culture of rapid iteration backed by rigorous QA, security reviews, and customer validation. Our two-week sprint cycles deliver continuous value without sacrificing quality.</p>

            <h3>4. Compounding Excellence</h3>
            <p>Small improvements matter. We invest in systems, processes, and habits that compound over time — from our codebase architecture to our customer success playbooks.</p>

            <h3>5. Inclusive by Design</h3>
            <p>We build products and teams that reflect the diversity of the enterprises we serve. Accessibility, internationalization, and cultural sensitivity are baked into our product development lifecycle.</p>

            <h3>Expansion Revenue</h3>
            <p>Our net revenue retention of 128% is driven by seat-based expansion (average customer grows users by 40% in year 2), tier upgrades (Starter → Growth conversion rate: 35%), and add-on modules. Expansion revenue represents 28% of new ARR bookings.</p>

                <li><strong>Consumerization:</strong> End users expect consumer-grade UX in enterprise tools, creating opportunity for modern challengers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Target Buyer Personas</h3>

            <h3>Primary: VP of Procurement / CPO</h3>
            <p>Responsible for procurement strategy and team efficiency. Pain points: manual processes, lack of spend visibility, vendor management complexity. Decision criteria: ease of deployment, ROI within 6 months, integration with existing ERP.</p>

            <h3>Secondary: CFO / VP Finance</h3>
            <p>Cares about spend control, budget compliance, and audit readiness. Often the budget holder and executive sponsor. Decision criteria: analytics quality, compliance features, total cost of ownership.</p>

            <h3>Influencer: IT / Security</h3>

                <li><strong>Mid-Market (500–5,000 employees):</strong> Underserved by legacy players. Our primary focus. 180K+ companies in US alone.</li>
                <li><strong>SMB (&lt;500 employees):</strong> Price-sensitive, high volume, low ACV. Future expansion opportunity via self-serve.</li>

            <h2>Competitive Landscape</h2>
            <p>The procurement software market has legacy incumbents serving enterprises and a growing set of modern challengers targeting the mid-market. Moran AI differentiates through AI-native architecture, rapid deployment, and superior UX.</p>

            <h3>Legacy Incumbents</h3>

            <h3>SAP Ariba</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Position:</strong> Market leader, ~$3B revenue</li>
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Deep SAP integration, largest vendor network, global reach</li>
                <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> 6–18 month implementation, $500K+ TCO, poor UX, not AI-native</li>
                <li><strong>Our Edge:</strong> We deploy in days vs. months. Our AI matching outperforms their rules-based engine.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Coupa</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Position:</strong> Strong #2, acquired by Thoma Bravo ($8B, 2023)</li>
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Good analytics, community intelligence, broad functionality</li>
                <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Expensive ($200K+ ACV), complex onboarding, PE-owned (slower innovation)</li>
                <li><strong>Our Edge:</strong> 80% lower TCO for mid-market buyers. Faster innovation cycle.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Modern UI, intake-focused, fast growing</li>
                <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Limited to intake/approvals — no vendor intelligence or spend analytics</li>
                <li><strong>Our Edge:</strong> Full platform vs. point solution. Our AI vendor matching is a unique capability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Competitive Moat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AI Vendor Matching:</strong> Proprietary ML models trained on 50M+ procurement transactions. Accuracy improves with each customer's data — a true network effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed to Value:</strong> Average deployment: 3 days. Average time to first automated PO: 1 week. Competitors take weeks to months.</li>

            <h3>Total Addressable Market (TAM): $47B</h3>
            <p>The global procurement software market, including all segments (enterprise, mid-market, SMB) and all geographies. Source: Gartner 2025 Market Guide for Procurement Software. Growing at 12.3% CAGR.</p>

            <h3>Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): $8.2B</h3>
            <p>Mid-market companies (500–5,000 employees) in the US and EU requiring cloud procurement solutions.</p>

                <li><strong>Average spend on procurement tools:</strong> $45,500/year</li>
                <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 400,000 × 45% × $45,500 = $8.19B</li>

            <p>Mid-market companies waste $480K+/year on manual procurement. Legacy solutions cost $500K+ to deploy and take 6–18 months. 72% of mid-market procurement teams still rely on email and spreadsheets.</p>

            <h3>Slide 3: The Solution</h3>
            <p>AI-powered procurement platform that deploys in days. Automates vendor matching, approvals, compliance, and spend analytics in one unified system.</p>

            <h3>Slide 4: Product Demo</h3>
            <p>Visual walkthrough of the requisition-to-PO workflow. Highlights: 3-minute request submission, 4-hour average approval cycle, AI vendor recommendations.</p>

            <h3>Slide 5: Traction</h3>
            <p>$2.04M ARR, 84 customers, 128% NRR, 12% MoM growth, 78% gross margin, 5.5x LTV:CAC.</p>

            <h3>Slide 6: Market</h3>
            <p>$47B TAM, $8.2B SAM (mid-market US+EU), 12.3% CAGR. Market shift from on-prem to cloud creating a generational opportunity.</p>

            <h3>Slide 7: Business Model</h3>
            <p>Three-tier SaaS subscription (Starter/Growth/Enterprise). Avg. ACV $24,300 with strong upsell path. 128% NRR demonstrates platform stickiness.</p>

            <h3>Slide 8: Competitive Advantage</h3>
            <p>AI vendor matching (proprietary, improves with scale), 3-day deployment (vs. months), purpose-built for mid-market (not a scaled-down enterprise tool).</p>

            <h3>Slide 9: Team</h3>
            <p>3 repeat founders (Stripe, Palantir, Salesforce). Previous exit: DataSync (acq. by Salesforce, $45M). 47 employees, engineering-led culture.</p>

            <h3>Slide 10: Financial Plan</h3>
            <p>Path to $40M ARR by 2029. EBITDA-positive in 2028. Capital-efficient: $1.55M revenue on $12.5M total funding.</p>

            <h3>Slide 11: Use of Funds</h3>
            <p>$18M Series B: 40% R&D (enterprise features, AI), 35% GTM (sales expansion, EU launch), 15% G&A (ops scaling), 10% buffer.</p>

            <h3>Slide 12: The Ask</h3>
            <p>Raising $18M Series B at $90M pre-money valuation. Targeting close by Q2 2026. Lead investor receives board seat.</p>

            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

            <h3>Opportunity</h3>
            <p>Moran AI is building the modern procurement operating system for mid-market enterprises. We automate the entire procure-to-pay lifecycle using AI, replacing manual processes that cost companies $480K+ annually in wasted labor and suboptimal vendor selection.</p>

            <h3>Why Now</h3>
            <p>Three converging forces are creating a once-in-a-decade opportunity: (1) cloud migration — 65% of mid-market firms plan to move procurement to the cloud by 2027, (2) AI maturity — LLMs and ML models now enable procurement automation that was impossible 3 years ago, and (3) regulatory pressure — new ESG and supply chain laws demand automated compliance tracking.</p>

            <h3>Traction</h3>
            <p>Since our Series A in mid-2024, we've grown ARR from $0.3M to $2.04M (580% growth), expanded from 12 to 84 customers, and maintained 128% net revenue retention. Our gross margin has improved from 72% to 79% as we've achieved infrastructure efficiencies at scale.</p>

            <h3>Product</h3>
            <p>Our platform includes four core modules — Intelligent Requisitioning, Smart Approval Workflows, Vendor Intelligence, and Spend Analytics — integrated into a single cloud-native application. We deploy in 3 days (vs. 6–18 months for legacy tools) and integrate with major ERPs, identity providers, and collaboration tools.</p>

            <h3>Team</h3>
            <p>Our three co-founders (Sarah Chen, Marcus Rodriguez, Priya Patel) have worked together for 8+ years, including co-founding DataSync (acquired by Salesforce for $45M in 2019). The team of 47 includes senior engineering talent from Stripe, Palantir, and Google.</p>

            <h3>Financial Plan</h3>
            <p>We project revenue growth from $1.55M (2025) to $40M (2029), reaching EBITDA breakeven in 2028. Our capital-efficient model has generated $1.55M in revenue on $12.5M in total funding — a 12.4% revenue-to-capital ratio, above median for Series A SaaS companies.</p>

            <h3>The Ask</h3>
            <p>We are raising an $18M Series B to fund: (1) enterprise product features (SSO, multi-entity, advanced AI), (2) EU market entry via London office, (3) sales team expansion from 6 to 18 quota-carrying reps. Target close: Q2 2026.</p>

            <h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>

            <h3>"Game-changer for our procurement team"</h3>
            <p><strong>Jennifer Walsh, VP of Procurement — TechCorp Industries</strong> (1,200 employees, technology)</p>
            <p>"Before Moran AI, our procurement process was a nightmare of spreadsheets, email chains, and manual vendor lookups. We were spending 3 weeks on average per purchase order. With Moran AI, we've cut that to under 48 hours. The AI vendor matching alone has saved us $340K in our first year by finding better-priced alternatives we didn't even know existed. The ROI was obvious within the first month."</p>

            <h3>"Finally, a procurement tool our employees actually want to use"</h3>
            <p><strong>Michael Torres, CFO — Cascade Financial Group</strong> (800 employees, financial services)</p>
            <p>"We tried Coupa before Moran AI and it was massively over-engineered for our needs — $300K implementation, 8 months to deploy, and our team hated using it. Moran AI was live in 2 days. Literally. Our adoption rate hit 94% in the first quarter because the UX is so intuitive. My finance team finally has real-time visibility into committed spend, which has eliminated our quarter-end budget surprises."</p>

            <h3>"The deployment speed is unreal"</h3>
            <p><strong>Aisha Johnson, Head of Operations — BrightPath Healthcare</strong> (650 employees, healthcare)</p>
            <p>"We evaluated five vendors and Moran AI was the only one that could get us live in under a week. With HIPAA compliance requirements, we expected the process to take months. Their team had us fully deployed with SSO integration and compliant workflows in 4 business days. Three months in, we've processed over 1,200 POs through the platform with zero compliance issues."</p>

            <h3>"Best vendor experience in 20 years of enterprise software"</h3>
            <p><strong>Robert Kim, CIO — NovaTech Manufacturing</strong> (2,100 employees, manufacturing)</p>
            <p>"I've been buying enterprise software for two decades and Moran AI is the best vendor experience I've had. Their customer success team is proactive, their product actually works as demoed (which is rare), and they ship meaningful updates every two weeks. When we asked for a custom SAP integration, they had it built and tested in 3 weeks. That kind of responsiveness from a software vendor is unheard of."</p>

            <h2>Case Study: TechCorp Industries</h2>
            <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Technology | <strong>Employees:</strong> 1,200 | <strong>Plan:</strong> Enterprise</p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>TechCorp's procurement team of 8 was processing 400+ purchase orders per month using a combination of email, Google Sheets, and a legacy on-premise tool that was being sunset. Average PO cycle time was 3 weeks. The CFO had no real-time visibility into committed spend, leading to consistent budget overruns in Q3 and Q4.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>TechCorp deployed Moran AI's Enterprise plan in 3 days, integrating with their Oracle NetSuite ERP and Okta SSO. The AI vendor matching module was trained on their historical purchase data within the first week, and the automated approval workflow replaced their 7-step email-based process.</p>

            <h3>Results (First 12 Months)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PO Cycle Time:</strong> Reduced from 21 days to 1.8 days (91% improvement)</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> $340,000 in vendor cost reductions via AI-recommended alternatives</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> 100% policy compliance on all POs (vs. 72% previously)</li>
                <li><strong>Team Productivity:</strong> Procurement team reallocated 60% of time to strategic sourcing</li>
                <li><strong>Adoption:</strong> 96% of employees actively using the platform</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Case Study: Cascade Financial Group</h2>
            <p><strong>Industry:</strong> Financial Services | <strong>Employees:</strong> 800 | <strong>Plan:</strong> Growth</p>

            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Cascade had previously attempted a Coupa implementation that failed after 8 months and $300K in sunk costs. Their procurement was still running on email and shared drives. The CFO needed real-time spend visibility for SOX compliance reporting and was frustrated by quarterly "budget surprise" conversations with department heads.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Cascade deployed Moran AI's Growth plan in 2 days with QuickBooks integration. The spend analytics dashboard gave the CFO immediate visibility into departmental spend vs. budget. Custom approval thresholds were configured for SOX-relevant spend categories.</p>

            <h3>Results (First 8 Months)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deployment Time:</strong> 2 days (vs. 8 months with previous vendor)</li>
                <li><strong>Total Cost:</strong> $42,000/year (vs. $300K+ with previous vendor)</li>
                <li><strong>Budget Accuracy:</strong> Quarterly spend variance reduced from 18% to 3%</li>
                <li><strong>Audit Readiness:</strong> Full procurement audit trail available in real-time</li>
                <li><strong>User Adoption:</strong> 94% adoption rate in first quarter</li>
